# ArchPack
This is a script to install all the software I need on a new arch system.

This script will install the following software:
- Bitwarden
- Discord
- github-desktop
- openrgb
- p7zip
- Spotify
- Steam
- ufw
- VSCode

Command to run the script from the terminal:  
`bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JerimiahOfficial/ArchPack/main/Install.sh)`
