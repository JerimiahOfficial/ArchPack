# ArchPack
### What is ArchPack?
ArchPack is a simple install script for Archlinux. This script installs Archlinux along with many packages that I use.

### Help or Issues
I have only tested this on [VMware Workstation 17 Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html) with the `firmware="efi"` setting in the virtual machine config file. This script has not been tested on actual hardware or inside of a non efi environment.

### Usage
This is the command to run the script from your terminal:  
`bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JerimiahOfficial/ArchPack/main/Install.sh)`
